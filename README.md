# Task_Managmet_System
Task Management System â€“ A Python Mastery Case Study

ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview:

Youâ€™ve built a modular, object-oriented task manager system that showcases fluency in Python fundamentals and advanced constructs. This project simulates a real-world application used to:

Add, manage, and filter tasks

Save/load data using JSON

Handle errors gracefully

Extend features like custom reminders

Operate in an organized, modular architecture

ðŸ”§ Concepts Mastered Per Phase
Phase	Concept	Description

1	Variables, Strings, Numbers	Defined task title, due date, and priority with correct data types

2	Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, Sets	Used to store and process tasks with various attributes

3	Control Flow	Implemented if, for, and conditions to drive the task logic

4	Functions, Lambda	Created reusable logic and on-the-fly filters

5	OOP: Classes, Inheritance, Iterators	Built Task, TaskList, with custom iterators & filtering logic

6	File I/O, Exception Handling	Loaded/saved tasks as JSON and gracefully handled file corruption

7	Decorators, Multithreading, Manual Triggers	Created a reminder decorator and allowed user-controlled execution

ðŸ§  Technical Skills Demonstrated

âœ… Software Design

Modular architecture (main.py, task.py, task_list.py, etc.)

Custom TaskList iterable class for iteration abstraction

âœ… Clean Code & Best Practices

Separated concerns between logic, I/O, and data representation

Used decorators for cross-cutting concerns (reminders/logging)

Used __name__ == "__main__" for executable script entry

âœ… Advanced Python Proficiency

List comprehensions for efficient filtering

Decorators to wrap functionality

Thread-safe design using manual triggers
